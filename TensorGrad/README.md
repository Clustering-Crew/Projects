# TensorGrad: A Vector Implementation of `micrograd` by Andrej Karpathy

In this section two subsections are available

1. The `micrograd` implementation as directed by Andrej Karpathy which handles scalar values.

2. The `TensorGrad` implementation that can handle tensors while the other features are the same as the `micrograd`.

The main aim of this work is to reinforce the foundational knowledge of neural nets and the math behind them.
