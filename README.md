# Implementing ViT using JAX / FLAX NNX
--- 

This repo contains the implementation of vision transfomer using JAX and its neural network wrapper Flax. Flax nnx is the API that enables the JAX JIT (just in time compilation). 

**Note: Currently the inputs can only be given as NPY files and no logging and plots are generated.**
